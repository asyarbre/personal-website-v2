- Fixed Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration to ensure push notifications are reliably delivered on the mobile app.
- Refactored the notification creation form to support dynamic input fields for flexible message configuration.
- Developed a Notification History page to track and audit previously sent notifications.
